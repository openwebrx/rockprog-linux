This is a modernized version of the "rockprog" tool for linux used for programming FiFiSDR devices. The original
code is left unchanged, only the build system has been redone with cmake.

In addition to that, this project holds the packaging instructions for the Debian / Ubuntu packages available from the
OpenWebRX repositories.

The original project page can be found [here](https://o28.sischa.net/fifisdr/trac). Original wiki page for rockprog is [here](https://o28.sischa.net/fifisdr/trac/wiki/rockprog).

The original source code of the project is kept in a subversion repository [here](http://o28.sischa.net/fifisdr/svn/trunk/Software/User-Software/rockprog-linux/) ([browsable version](https://o28.sischa.net/fifisdr/trac/browser/trunk/Software/User-Software/rockprog-linux)).
